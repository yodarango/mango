### TODO

- play/{id} the warriors for each user are grouped by type, seems like. they must not be groupped at all.

### Left off

- on the playing graph, it is working smoothly and it is basically done. I just need the following:
  - when a user moves an asset over another asset, this should prompt a battle
  - decide whether the available moves by each user must show
  - decide whether to allow a user to retire an asset
